If you’re considering building an offshore team, it’s essential to recognise that your team’s well-being is just as important as their productivity. When evaluating outsourcing partners, don’t just focus on their processes and capabilities. Inquire about their commitment to employee welfare, especially in the context of remote work. A partner who prioritises the mental and physical health of their employees will likely have a more engaged and productive team, ultimately benefiting your business.
